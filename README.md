This repository is a pared down version of Manfred Steyer's module-federation-plugin-example that adds a simple ngxs store to the shell and microfrontend to reproduce an issue with ngxs feature modules loaded via webpack 5 module federation.

run "npm start" to see the issue, I've added text to the home page that explains the problem.
